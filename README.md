## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Topical maps, internal link logic, crawl budget control, entity-based structuring â€” thatâ€™s my playground. While others chase algorithms, I make pages speak Googleâ€™s language natively.

I donâ€™t sell backlinks. I donâ€™t chase keywords. I build ecosystems â€” scalable, indexable, semantically bulletproof. Whether itâ€™s programmatic content, white-hat automation, or cleaning up a bloated CMS, I get in, fix fast, and ship clean.

I work solo. No agency layers, no fluff. Just technical work that makes your site crawlable, indexable, and useful.
