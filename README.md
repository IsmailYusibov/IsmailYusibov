## Hi.


Topical maps, internal link logic, crawl budget control, entity-based structuring — that’s my playground. While others chase algorithms, I make pages speak Google’s language natively.

I don’t sell backlinks. I don’t chase keywords. I build ecosystems — scalable, indexable, semantically bulletproof. Whether it’s programmatic content, white-hat automation, or cleaning up a bloated CMS, I get in, fix fast, and ship clean.

I work solo. No agency layers, no fluff. Just technical work that makes your site crawlable, indexable, and useful.
